# Housing Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a housing dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  

## Included Notebook

The file `Linear_Polynomial_regression_with_regularization.ipynb` provides various regression analyses conducted on the dataset, including:  
- **Vanilla (multi)linear regression**: Performed on datasets with and without one-hot encoded categorical variables.  
- **Lasso and Ridge regularization**: Implementation of penalization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Polynomial regression**: Exploring the effects of polynomial transformations on model performance.  

Feel free to explore the notebook to understand the different regression techniques applied and their results.
